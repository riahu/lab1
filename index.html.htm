        <h1>Sakura Kinomoto</h1>

        <img src="img/headshot.jpg" alt="Sakura-chan">

        <p><strong>Sakura Kinomoto</strong>, like most 10-year old girls, hates waking up in the morning, her brother (sometimes), and when Kero eats her food. What sets her apart from her peers (besides her general cluelessness) is that she's the mistress of the <em>Sakura Cards<em> (formerly known as the <em>Clow Cards</em>) that have magical powers. While not the smartest of girls, she is dedicated and loyal to those she deems her friends. She is more or less perpetually cheerful.</p>

        <p>Sakura is from the anime series "Card Captor Sakura". While the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakura_Kinomoto">Wikipedia article</a> is a good overview of her in the series, the <a href="http://ccs.wikia.com/wiki/Sakura_Kinomoto">fan wiki article</a> is much more in-depth.</p>
